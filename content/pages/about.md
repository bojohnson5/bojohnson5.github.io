As of the time I'm writing this page I am a PhD candidate in 
physics at Indiana University. I'm studying how low-energy
(less than 50 MeV, for those who know) neutrinos 
interact in a liquid argon detector. This particular process has a long
name, coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS,
pronounced "sevens"), and it has only recently been observed
by the [collaboration](https://sites.duke.edu/coherent/) 
I'm a part of. CEvNS gives a novel means
of testing the standard model, our current best understanding
of all the forces and particles in the universe and how they
interact with each other (excepting, of course, gravity, for now?).
Not only can we test standard model predictions but theories
which posit new particles and interactions beyond the standard
model (BSM) can also be probed by CEvNS experiments. This
somewhat nascent field has exciting opportunities and important 
contributions to make to the field of particle physics.

In addition to being a physicist (I can call myself that now,
right?) I have a wife and two (soon to be three) small kids. 
We live in east Tennessee where I work on my research at [Oak
Ridge National Laboratory](www.ornl.gov). So if I'm not talking about
vacuum pumps, cryogenic liquids or data analysis I'll probably
be talking about Paw Patrol, Frozen, or building an airport
with [MAGNA-TILES](www.magnatiles.com).
